# guest-kubelet

A throwaway prototype of a *guest kubelet*: a [virtual-kubelet](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet)
(v1.14.0) that registers a virtual Node (`vk-<host>`) next to a real GPU node and acts as the
kubelet for the guest pods scheduled onto it.

## Status: M1 (mirror pods)

- Registers Node `vk-<host suffix>` (for example `vk-abcd`) with labels `type=virtual-kubelet`,
  `timeslice.io/virtual-node=true`, taint `timeslice.io/guest=true:NoSchedule`, capacity
  `cpu`/`memory`/`pods`/`nvidia.com/gpu: 1`, and the host's IP as `InternalIP`. No
  `kubernetes.io/os` label, which keeps GKE's system DaemonSets off it.
- A guest is a pod bound to the node that tolerates `timeslice.io/guest` by key. For each one the
  VK creates a mirror pod `<guest>-m` pinned to the host (`internal/backend/mirror`):
  - scheduling fields, probes, readiness gates and guest labels are removed;
  - labels `timeslice.io/mirror-of=<guest UID>` and `timeslice.io/mirror-node=<vnode>` are added;
  - requests are capped at `--mirror-cpu-headroom` / `--mirror-memory-headroom`;
  - `nvidia.com/gpu` is replaced by the ResourceClaim `--gpu-claim`, which must already be
    allocated on the host (by the trainer).
- A label-filtered informer copies the mirror's status to the guest: phase, IPs, start time,
  conditions and container states.
- Deleting the guest deletes the mirror with the guest's grace period. The guest is removed as
  soon as the mirror has stopped.
- Leader election (`--leader-elect`, Lease `guest-kubelet-<vnode>`) runs 2 replicas. On restart
  or failover, existing mirrors are found again and nothing is re-created.
- `--mirror-owner-ref=false` lets mirrors outlive guests that were force-deleted after a Node
  deletion. A guest re-created with the same name and the same containers re-adopts the mirror
  (same UID and IP). Orphans are deleted after `--orphan-grace`.
- Not yet: probes (a guest is Ready when its container starts), logs/exec (use `kubectl logs
  <guest>-m`), stats.

## Layout

```
cmd/guest-kubelet/main.go            flags; leader election; nodeutil.NewNode wiring; own event recorder
internal/provider/node.go            the Node spec (labels, taint, capacity, conditions); NodeProvider
internal/provider/provider.go        the pod provider: guest filter, hands guests to the backend
internal/provider/events.go          drops events about non-guest pods
internal/backend/mirror/builder.go   guest -> mirror pod (pure function)
internal/backend/mirror/status.go    mirror status -> guest status
internal/backend/mirror/backend.go   create/adopt/delete mirrors, mirror informer, orphan GC
internal/backend/mirror/claim.go     optional reservedFor write (kube-controller-manager also does it)
deploy/                              namespace + SA, RBAC, Deployment, CPU test guest + Service
deploy/m1/                           claim + trainer stand-in, vLLM guest, StatefulSet guest,
                                     rollout-test DaemonSet, curl client, driver installer, VAP test
cloudbuild.yaml                      tidy check, vet, test, build, image push (nothing runs locally)
```

## Build and deploy

```
make build        # Cloud Build: tidy check, go vet, go test -race, image -> Artifact Registry
make deploy       # namespace, RBAC, Deployment on the test cluster (HOST=<real node>)
make test-guest   # CPU guest + Service
make gpu-guest    # claim + trainer stand-in, then the vLLM guest
make status
make undeploy
```

The plan and the notes explaining this code are kept outside this repository
(prototype plan, milestones M0 and M1).

## M1 results (the test cluster, 2026-09-25)

- Echo guest Running with the mirror's IP; `curl <podIP>:8080` and the Service work from a
  default-pool node.
- vLLM guest (approach-7 args) sees the L4 through the claim and served a completion.
- Deleting a guest: mirror and guest gone in 1.6 s (quick exit); 10.5 s for a container that
  ignores SIGTERM, with grace 10.
- A 7.5-CPU guest with the cap off: kubelet rejects the mirror (`OutOfcpu`) and the guest shows
  the same. With the cap on, the mirror requests 1 CPU and runs.
- kube-controller-manager adds a mirror to the claim's `reservedFor` by itself (~1 s).
- Leader failover ~2 s; several VK restarts: same mirror UID and IP, no duplicate.
- providerID: denied by GKE's `validate-node-providerid` admission policy.
- VK stopped 3 min: Node deleted at +60 s. With ownerRef, guests and mirrors are gone at +103 s.
  Without ownerRef, mirrors keep serving (vLLM answered throughout). The StatefulSet pod and
  re-applied bare pods re-adopt their mirrors with the same IP.
- A DaemonSet that lands on the node stalls its rolling update (maxUnavailable 1). A policy that
  denies the pod does not help.

## M0 results (the test cluster, 2026-09-25)

- Node registered in ~3 s; Lease renewed every 10 s; Ready for a 30-minute soak with no foreign
  taints or conditions.
- Test guest Running with 198.18.0.1 within a second; the EndpointSlice listed it (removed within
  2 s of delete; the object itself goes after the 30 s grace period).
- Five system DaemonSets land on the node and stay Pending (guest filter). The library's env
  resolution failed on three of them until `SkipDownwardAPIResolution` was set (commit 5e68be8).
- Outage: with the VK stopped, the node went NotReady at +51 s and the cloud node lifecycle
  controller deleted it at +54 s ("does not exist in the cloud provider"); its pods were
  garbage-collected ~40 s later. The VK re-creates the Node on restart.
- metrics-server scrapes InternalIP:10250, i.e. the real kubelet, so `kubectl top node vk-abcd`
  shows the real host.
